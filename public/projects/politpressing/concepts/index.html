            <p>The term "political persecution" - evaluation, and the key issue in all debates about the political repression in Russia boils down to who and how to evaluate them.</p>
            
            <p>PolitPressing.Org collects and analyzes data that have already been evaluated by different human rights organizations. At the moment, we rely primarily on the information of the Human Rights Centre "Memorial", Information-analytical center "Sova", Amnesty International, the Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners. Assessment of the organization included in the data set, and the status attributed to the organization indicated by the logo of the organization that gives it.</p>
            
            <p>The methodology of these organizations varies. Nevertheless, the basic guideline for PolitPressing.Org and most human rights organizations are the criteria developed by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. According to these criteria a person is considered a political prisoner if:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The arrest violates the basic guarantees of the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular as regards the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of vyrazheniyamneniya and information, as well as freedom of assembly and association;</li>
            <li>Arrest imposed for purely political reasons;</li>
            <li>Term and conditions of detention are not proportional to the gravity of the offense;</li>
            <li>The arrest is discriminatory in comparison with others;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The conclusion was the result of legal proceedings which were manifestly unjust character and were associated with political motives.</p>
            <p>Should be clear that the recognition of a person "political prisoner" does not necessarily mean he was innocent, and people justifiably accused of violent crimes, can not be considered "political prisoners" even according to other criteria.</p>
            <p>At the same preamble based methodology used in their assessments of the HRC "Memorial" and the Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners (see. Guidelines for the definition of "political prisoner").</p>
            <p>"Sova" is not involved in the assessment of those or other harassment as politically motivated. However, the organization's prosecution under the anti-extremist legislation as lawful or unlawful. If "Owl" recognizes the illegal persecution, we include such persecution database PolitPressing.Org, because the very anti-extremist legislation and is intended, in fact, it controls the social and political activities.</p>
